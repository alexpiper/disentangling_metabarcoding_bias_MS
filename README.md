# Disentangling bias for non-destructive insect metabarcoding

This repository contains the code required for reproducing the analyses presented in our manuscript: F. Martoni, A.M. Piper, B. Rodoni and M.J. Blacket: Disentangling bias for non-destructive insect metabarcoding. (In prep)

## Data

The input sequencing data are not included in the repository for size reasons, and are instead available from the SRA under accession: ** Coming Soon **

However RDS files holding intermediate data objects such as the OTU and taxonomy tables suitable for performing the analyses are contained within output/rds and these can be used to reproduce the statistical analyses.

## Analysis 

The bioinformatic workflow used to analyse the sequence data can be found in the bioinformatics.rmd file in the root directory or rendered: [Here](https://alexpiper.github.io/metabarcoding_bias_partition/bioinformatics.html)

The statistical analyses can be found in the statistics.rmd file in the root directory or rendered: [Here](https://alexpiper.github.io/metabarcoding_bias_partition/statistics.html)
